I am producing a lengthy 1-hour long podcast episode. Mentioned below is the name of the topic, along with the list of numbered points for it. Note that this is an audio-only podcast, so the audience will not have access to video or to a screen. Also note that the audience is a mixed audience with an interest in the topic, operating at a variety of skill levels (novice / junior / mid / senior). The audience relies on the podcast to learn skills to earn their living, so they must learn everything that they need to know; their interest is both academic and pragmatic. In effect, the audience is empowered with information.

Your task is to write the corresponding educational podcast thesis for the specific numbered point below. This text will subsequently be vocalized using a text-to-speech generator. Avoid fluff or filler content. As applicable, feel encouraged to take people into the future with novel ideas rather than rehash dated perspectives. As always, stick to well-documented facts, eschewing unverified information, even if this means that the thesis will be smaller.

For technical topics, avoid software code and fancy mathematical equations as they are hard to vocalize. You must skip any fancy formatting such as bold or backticks or even parentheses, as these can otherwise confuse the text-to-speech generator. Use simpler words whenever possible to assist in easier understanding, but without sacrificing the quality of the content. You are not writing to be read; you are in effect writing to be listened. Do not otherwise comment on the task.{optional_continuation}

For your information, in a subsequent step, I will myself merge the generated content for all numbered points into a single podcast episode.

The topic for the podcast is: {topic}

For your reference, the full list of intended numbered points for the podcast is:

{subtopics}


The current specific topic on which you are to expound at great length is:
